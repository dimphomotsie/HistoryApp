History App Report

This app was made and specifically curated for a history educator who wants to use the great power of technology to inspire fresh young minds to learn more about history and it will not only be educational, but also fun and exciting for students. I created an Android app that will do exactly so. This android app will take a person’s age as input then match the age to different people in history when they passed away.
I designed an aesthetically pleasing and very engaging user interface that will grab the attention of students. I used graphics of well-known people in history that will instantly attract attention, I also used a background colour that will definitely catch the students’ attention. The interface is intuitive and very simple and will be nowhere near difficult for students to interact with. It was made with attention to target young, bright and eager to learn pupils.

The app itself has about twelve famous people in history who have passed away. Logic has been implemented to match the age for the person who has passed away. This will ensure that only one famous person in history will appear to the age requested. 
The display of the app shows the name of the app itself, which is ‘The History App’. Under the name of the app are engaging images of iconic famous people who have passed away, following an Edit text for the user to input the age, underneath that a generate history button so that once it is pressed the app will display to the user the result of the age they have entered, and beside that a clear button that will erase the age and the history information displayed. Lastly at the bottom is a Text view that will show information or a message only when the user has input an age and pressed the generate history button.
I made certain that my app handles input errors that will provide positive feedback to students if they enter invalid age information. Talking more about the Text view. When the user inputs a whole number that correlates to a famous person who has passed away at the age that was inserted then the Text view will display who the famous person is and facts about that person. If the user inputs an age presented as a decimal or a number presented as words, the Text view will display a message saying “Invalid input. Please ensure that you enter a valid age which is a whole number between 20 and 100.” If the user inputs an age that falls outside of the range of 20 and 100 the Text view will display a message saying “Invalid Input. Please ensure that you enter a valid which is a whole number between 20 and 100.” When the user inputs an age that is lies within the correct range but does not have a famous person who passed away correlating to that age then the Text view will display a message saying, “No famous person found with the entered age.”
A simple written down walk through:
For example, when the user inputs the age of 30 and presses the generate history button, Steve Biko will automatically appear in the Text view with facts relating to him. When the user inputs age represented as a decimal or a fraction (e.g. 35.5 or 35 ½) or if the age is presented as in words (e.g. forty-five) and then user presses the generate history button the Text view will display a message saying, “Invalid input. Please ensure that you enter a valid age which is a whole number between 20 and 100.” If the user inputs an age that falls outside of the range of 20 and 100 (e.g. 15 or 105) and then presses the generate history button the Text view will display a message saying, “Invalid Input. Please ensure that you enter a valid which is a whole number between 20 and 100.” When the user inputs an age that lies within the correct range but does not have a famous person who passed away correlating to that age (e.g. 33) and then presses the generate history button then the Text view will display a message saying, “No famous person found with the entered age.”
Once my coding was completed and my app was running efficiently and effectively on the emulator, I moved on to version control with GitHub. I created a new repository for my project then initialised my repository with a README file. Once that was completed, I commit and pushed my project files to the GitHub repository. At times when I was editing my code I would regularly commit and push my project files to GitHub.

Once version control was completed, I moved on to testing and automated testing. I thoroughly conducted manual testing to make sure that the app runs smoothly and provides an exciting and fun experience for the students. I made use of GitHub actions to run tests and when building my code, I made sure that it does not just work on my computer, but on an Android Smartphone as well.
